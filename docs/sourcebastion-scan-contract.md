# SourceBastion scan contract

`contract-scan` is the portable M036 boundary used by hosted executors and
customer CI. It accepts a trusted, canonical `sourcebastion.scan-plan.v1` JSON
file and writes a canonical `sourcebastion.scan-result.v1` envelope.

```bash
ez-appsec contract-scan /workspace/source \
  --plan /workspace/input/scan-plan.json \
  --result-envelope /workspace/output/scan-result.json \
  --scanner-image \
    ghcr.io/ez-appsec/ez-appsec@sha256:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

`--scanner-image` may instead be supplied through
`SOURCEBASTION_SCANNER_IMAGE`. It must be the immutable digest in the plan. The
checkout's locally observed Git `HEAD` must also equal the plan's exact head.

The command validates the plan version, canonical digest, identities, baseline
proof, component compatibility keys, modes, scopes, and declared limits before
running a scanner. It rejects traversal and ambiguous paths, oversized plans or
source trees, stale baseline proofs, and mismatched checkout or image identity.
Output is written atomically and includes one result for every planned
component, the observed head, plan and image binding, bounded status and
diagnostic codes, timestamps, and a canonical envelope digest.

S03/T03 supports partial Gitleaks, Semgrep, and custom-PHP execution against
complete copies of the planner's covered files. Contract full and partial
Gitleaks execution both use current-tree `dir` mode so scoped replacement is
equivalent to full coverage. The legacy `ez-appsec scan` command retains its
separate Git-history scan. Repository Gitleaks and Semgrep ignore controls
remain active, and findings outside the assigned scope make the component
incomplete. Planned `reuse` is represented as an expected `not_run` result;
S03/T04 adds KICS execution over complete planned IaC files or directories.
Local Terraform module references must resolve inside the planned unit set;
unresolved or out-of-scope references report `scope_unresolved` so the trusted
platform can schedule a full fallback. Grype partial mode remains unsupported
until its capability task lands. The existing `ez-appsec scan` JSON output is
unchanged.

S03/T06 caps each finding, total finding metadata, metadata depth, and the final
result envelope. Duplicate logical findings and malformed core finding fields
make the component incomplete. A component interrupted by cancellation records
`failed` with the bounded `cancelled` diagnostic and still produces a complete
result envelope for the trusted fallback path. The plan's execution deadline is
also propagated to scanner discovery, preparation, database refreshes, and tool
processes so a component's larger built-in timeout cannot overrun the plan.

The scanner process needs the source tree, plan, and output path only. Do not
mount provider, platform API, database, or orchestration credentials into the
scanner container.
