# SourceBastion Scan

**AI-powered application security scanning** — free, open-source, works with GitHub and GitLab.

The CLI, Python package, and existing container images retain the `ez-appsec`
name for compatibility. This repository is their maintained upstream home;
it is not deprecated.

SourceBastion Scan orchestrates four best-in-class scanners (gitleaks, semgrep, kics, grype), normalises their output into a unified schema, and pushes results to a hosted security dashboard. No cloud account or API key required.

## Quickstart with Claude Code

The fastest way to add SourceBastion Scan to any repository is through the Claude Code skill.

**Step 1 — Install the skill** (one-time, works in every project):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner/main/skills/install.sh | bash
```

**Step 2 — Add SourceBastion Scan to a repository:**

```
# GitHub
/ez-appsec install-app owner/repo

# GitLab
/ez-appsec install /path/to/repo
```

That's it. The skill provisions the workflow, sets secrets, and triggers the first scan automatically.

## SourceBastion Scan Skills Reference

The `/ez-appsec` Claude Code skill is a dispatcher — the first word routes to the right subcommand.

### Installation

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ez-appsec install-app [owner/repo]` | **GitHub** — installs the scan workflow, provisions App secrets, and triggers the first scan |
| `/ez-appsec install [path]` | **GitLab** — patches `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the `scan.yml` include and opens a merge request |
| `/ez-appsec install-dashboard [owner/repo]` | **GitHub** — creates and configures the dashboard repo with GitHub Pages and App secrets |

### Scanning

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ez-appsec scan [path]` | Scan with Docker and load findings into context for analysis |
| `/ez-appsec load [project]` | Load a project's vulnerabilities from the dashboard into context for analysis |
| `/ez-appsec remediate [filter]` | Prioritized fix plan balancing severity vs risk — applies safe fixes immediately, confirms risky ones once |

### Maintenance

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ez-appsec update-dashboard [owner/repo]` | Re-provision App secrets and update dashboard web assets to the latest release |
| `/ez-appsec uninstall-app [owner/repo]` | **GitHub** — removes the scan workflow and prunes the repo's dashboard data |
| `/ez-appsec uninstall [path]` | **GitLab** — removes the `scan.yml` include via merge request |

### Help

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ez-appsec help` | Print available subcommands |

## Scanners

| Scanner | What it finds |
|---------|--------------|
| [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | Secrets and credentials (140+ patterns) |
| [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/) | SAST — logic bugs, injection, misuse (1000+ rules) |
| [kics](https://www.kics.io/) | Infrastructure-as-code misconfigurations |
| [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) | Known CVEs in dependencies and SBOMs |

All findings are normalised into a unified schema with consistent severity levels, file paths, and line numbers.

## Known Limitations

SourceBastion Scan is in active development. Current coverage and accuracy reflect testing against OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, and production codebases. See [TEST_RESULTS.md](TEST_RESULTS.md) for full details.

### Detection Accuracy

| Category | Detection Rate | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Infrastructure/Config (KICS) | ~100% | 254 findings, 12.5% false positive rate |
| Secrets Scanning | 0% | Gitleaks integration pending |
| SQL Injection | 0% | Pattern-based rules planned |
| XSS | 0% | Framework-specific rules needed |
| Authentication Failures | 0% | Runtime analysis required |
| CSRF | 0% | CSRF token patterns only |

### Coverage Gaps (High Priority)

1. **Secrets Scanning** (Critical) - Hardcoded API keys, credentials, tokens
2. **SQL Injection** - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite patterns
3. **XSS** - Reflected, stored, DOM-based XSS
4. **NoSQL Injection** - MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
5. **Framework-Specific** - Laravel, Django, Spring, Express security patterns

### False Positive Sources

1. **Code Quality Issues** (~75%) - Unused imports, style violations
2. **Context-Insensitive Matches** (~20%) - String literals flagged as SQL
3. **Test Code** (~5%) - Test fixtures flagged

False positives can be suppressed using `.gitleaks.toml` (gitleaks) and `.semgrepignore` (semgrep) files.

### Performance Characteristics

| Codebase Size | Files | Scan Time | Memory |
|---------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Small | 50 | <10s | <500MB |
| Medium | 200 | <30s | <1GB |
| Large | 1,000 | <120s | <2GB |

Linear scaling validated. CI/CD compatible: GitHub Actions (2-core, 7GB), GitLab CI (4-core, 4GB).

## Docker Images

```bash
# Standard (all scanners)
docker pull ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:latest

# Slim (~300 MB, no semgrep)
docker pull ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:slim

# Micro (secrets + CVEs only)
docker pull ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:micro

# Run a scan
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/scan" \
  ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:latest scan /scan
```

Full-version and full-commit tags are immutable. Every release image includes
an SBOM and signed GitHub build provenance. Verify a pinned image with:

```bash
gh attestation verify \
  oci://ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner@sha256:<digest> \
  --repo sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner
```

The legacy `ghcr.io/ez-appsec/ez-appsec` images remain available for existing
immutable pins while consumers migrate; new integrations should use the
SourceBastion namespace.

## AI Remediation

When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the scanning environment, each finding is enriched with:
- Plain-language risk explanation
- Step-by-step fix instructions
- Code example where applicable

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from humans, AI agents, and human+AI teams.

There are two contribution paths depending on the size of the change.

### Small changes — no plan required

Bug fixes, documentation corrections, minor refactors, and small tweaks can go straight to a PR.

Open a **[Small Change issue](https://github.com/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner/issues/new?template=small-change.md)** to track the work, then submit a PR that references it. The bar is: `pytest tests/` passes, no scope creep.

### Significant work — plan first

New features, integrations, and anything that touches multiple modules require a plan before implementation begins. This prevents conflicts between contributors working in parallel and keeps PRs reviewable.

**Option A — Claim an existing roadmap item**

Browse the [repository roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and pick an unassigned plan. Leave
a comment on its issue before starting work. The issue contains scope,
technical approach, and done criteria.

**Option B — Propose a new plan**

If your idea is not on the roadmap, open a **[Plan issue](https://github.com/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner/issues/new?template=plan.md)** first. Describe what you are building, the scope, technical approach, and test strategy. Wait for a maintainer to acknowledge before opening a draft PR. This avoids duplicate work and surfaces conflicts early.

### Human + AI workflows

AI-assisted contributions are encouraged. When using Claude Code or another agent to implement a plan:

- The plan issue is the agent's scope boundary — it should not touch modules outside the plan
- Use `/ez-appsec test` to verify nothing regressed before opening a PR
- The PR description should note which parts were AI-generated and which were human-reviewed
- All tests must pass; the agent is not exempt from the done criteria

### Ground rules

- **Tests ship with the code.** Every plan lists required test files. PRs without tests for new behavior will not be merged.
- **Plans are independent.** If your change conflicts with another open plan, coordinate in the issue before proceeding.
- **Schema is append-only.** The `vulnerabilities.json` schema may gain new fields but existing fields must not be renamed or removed — downstream tools depend on them.
- **Docker size budget.** Adding a runtime dependency requires verifying the standard image stays under 2 GB.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full list of planned work and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for environment setup and coding conventions.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the path to feature parity with commercial AppSec platforms — 20 independent plans across developer feedback, compliance, platform expansion, enterprise features, and observability. Each plan is claimable by any contributor (human or AI).

## Support

SourceBastion Scanner is maintained on a best-effort basis. Issues and pull
requests are welcome and read, but there is no response-time commitment and
issues may be closed unanswered. Security reports use the private route in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Paying customers should use their commercial
support channel rather than the public tracker.

If maintenance stops, the repository will be archived with a prominent notice
rather than left appearing actively supported.
