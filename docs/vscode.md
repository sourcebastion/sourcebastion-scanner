# VS Code Extension

Inline security vulnerability diagnostics for VS Code, powered by SourceBastion Scan. Findings appear as editor squiggles on the exact lines where issues were detected — no context-switching to a terminal or browser.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** installed and running (the extension runs scans inside the SourceBastion Scan Docker image)
- **VS Code** 1.85.0 or later

---

## Installation

Build and install from source:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
npx vsce package
code --install-extension ez-appsec-0.1.0.vsix
```

---

## Status Bar

The extension adds a status bar item in the bottom-left corner:

| State | Display | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Idle (no findings) | `$(shield) SourceBastion Scan` | Click to run a workspace scan |
| Idle (with findings) | `$(shield) SourceBastion Scan: 5 findings` | Shows total findings across all files |
| Scanning | `$(sync~spin) SourceBastion Scan: scanning…` | Animated spinner during scan |

The status bar updates after both full workspace scans and single-file scan-on-save.

---

## Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `SourceBastion Scan: Scan Workspace` | Run a full security scan of the entire workspace (cancellable via the progress notification) |
| `SourceBastion Scan: Clear Findings` | Remove all diagnostic squiggles |

---

## Settings

Configure in **Settings** (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`) or `.vscode/settings.json`:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `ez-appsec.scanOnSave` | boolean | `false` | Automatically scan the saved file when any file is saved |
| `ez-appsec.scanOnSaveDelay` | number | `2000` | Debounce delay (ms) before triggering scan-on-save — prevents rapid repeated scans during burst saves |
| `ez-appsec.dockerImage` | string | `ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:latest` | Docker image to use for scanning |

### Example `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "ez-appsec.scanOnSave": true,
  "ez-appsec.scanOnSaveDelay": 3000,
  "ez-appsec.dockerImage": "ghcr.io/sourcebastion/sourcebastion-scanner:v1.7.31"
}
```

---

## How It Works

### Full workspace scan

1. Run **SourceBastion Scan: Scan Workspace** from the Command Palette (or click the status bar item).
2. A progress notification appears with a **Cancel** button — cancelling kills the Docker process immediately.
3. The extension mounts your workspace read-only into the Docker container and runs `ez-appsec scan /src`.
4. Results are written to a temporary `vulnerabilities.json`, parsed, and displayed as inline diagnostics across all files.
5. A notification shows the total finding count when the scan completes, and the status bar updates.

### Scan on save (single-file)

When `ez-appsec.scanOnSave` is enabled:

1. Saving a file triggers a **single-file scan** — only the saved file is scanned, not the entire workspace.
2. The scan is debounced: rapid saves within `scanOnSaveDelay` milliseconds are coalesced into one scan.
3. Diagnostics for the saved file are updated without clearing findings for other files.

This keeps the editor responsive even on large projects where a full workspace scan might take 30+ seconds.

### Diagnostic display

Findings map to VS Code diagnostic severities:

| Finding severity | VS Code display |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Critical | Red squiggle (Error) |
| High | Red squiggle (Error) |
| Medium | Yellow squiggle (Warning) |
| Low | Blue squiggle (Information) |
| Info | Blue squiggle (Information) |

Each diagnostic shows a short inline message in the format `[SEVERITY] message`. Hover or expand the diagnostic to see related information:

- **Rule name** — the scanner rule that triggered the finding (shown as `diagnostic.code`)
- **Fix suggestion** — recommended remediation (in Related Information)
- **AI hint** — AI-generated remediation guidance, when available (in Related Information)

The `diagnostic.code` uses the format `rule:file:line` for unique fingerprinting, so findings are stable across scans even when line numbers shift.

### Key modules

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `src/extension.ts` | Activation, command registration, scan-on-save with debounce and error throttling, status bar lifecycle, cancellation support |
| `src/scanner.ts` | Docker invocation for full-workspace and single-file scans, cancellation token support, result parsing, temp directory lifecycle |
| `src/diagnostics.ts` | Manages the `ez-appsec` diagnostic collection — severity mapping, `rule:file:line` fingerprinting, related information for fix/AI hints, per-file and bulk updates, total finding count |

## Scan-on-Save Design

The scan-on-save feature is designed to avoid blocking the editor:

1. **Single-file scope** — only the saved file is scanned via `docker run ... scan /src/relative/path`, not the entire `/src` mount. This reduces scan time from tens of seconds to a few seconds.

2. **Debounced** — rapid saves (e.g., auto-save or saving multiple files quickly) are coalesced. Only the last save within the `scanOnSaveDelay` window triggers a scan.

3. **Non-destructive updates** — `updateFileFindings()` sets diagnostics for the saved file only, preserving existing diagnostics for all other files. A full workspace scan still clears and replaces everything.

4. **Path validation** — files outside the workspace root are silently skipped (the relative path check rejects `..` traversals and absolute paths).

5. **Error throttling** — if Docker fails during scan-on-save (e.g., daemon not running), only one error toast is shown per 30 seconds. This prevents error spam when saving frequently with Docker unavailable.

---

## Docker Image

The extension defaults to `ghcr.io/ez-appsec/ez-appsec:latest`. Override this to pin a specific version or use a custom image:

```json
{
  "ez-appsec.dockerImage": "ghcr.io/ez-appsec/ez-appsec:v1.2.0"
}
```

The workspace is always mounted **read-only** (`:ro`). Scan output is written to a temporary directory that is cleaned up after each scan.

If Docker is not running, the extension shows:

> "Docker is not available. Please ensure Docker is installed and running."

---

## Development

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile    # TypeScript → JavaScript
npm test           # Run unit tests (vitest)
npm run watch      # Watch mode for development
npm run package    # Build .vsix for distribution
```

### Tests

The test suite covers:

| Test file | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `test/extension.test.ts` | Command registration, activation, error handling for missing workspace |
| `test/scanner.test.ts` | Result parsing, missing files, empty results, malformed JSON, filtering findings without locations |
| `test/diagnostics.test.ts` | Severity mapping (critical/high/medium/low), line number conversion, file grouping, AI hint display, `updateFileFindings` single-file updates |

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "Docker is not available" error | Docker daemon not running | Start Docker Desktop or `sudo systemctl start docker` |
| No squiggles after scan | Scan found 0 findings, or findings lack location data | Check the notification message for finding count; dependency-only findings (no file/line) are filtered out |
| Stale squiggles after editing | Diagnostics are only updated on scan, not on edit | Re-save the file (with scan-on-save enabled) or re-run **Scan Workspace** |
| Scan-on-save feels slow | Large file or slow Docker startup | Increase `scanOnSaveDelay` to batch saves; ensure Docker has adequate resources |
| Squiggles on wrong lines | File was edited after the scan | Re-scan to refresh line numbers |
| Only one Docker error shown despite multiple save failures | Error throttling is active (30s cooldown) | This is expected — prevents error toast spam when Docker is down |
| Status bar shows stale count | Finding count updates only after scans | Re-run **Scan Workspace** or save a file (with scan-on-save enabled) to refresh |
| "Scan cancelled" message | Scan was cancelled via the progress notification Cancel button | Expected behavior — re-run the scan when ready |
